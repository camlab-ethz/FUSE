The joint prediction of continuous fields and statistical estimation of the underlying discrete parameters is a common problem for many physical systems, governed by PDEs. Until now, these two problems were often tackled separately. In this work, we show that by incorporating underlying discrete parameters into the prediction of continuous fields, it is possible to improve the accuracy and robustness of the neural operator. Moreover, it adds a level of *interpretability*, surpassing the blackbox paradigm of previous neural operator approaches and allowing for human understanding of complex systems. We present the capabilities of the proposed methodology for predicting continuous and discrete biomarkers in full-body haemodynamics simulations under different levels of missing information. We also consider a test case for atmospheric large-eddy simulation of a two-dimensional dry cold bubble, where we infer both continuous time-series and information about the systems conditions. We present comparisons against different baselines to showcase significantly increased accuracy in both the inverse and the surrogate tasks.
